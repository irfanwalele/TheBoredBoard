MVP:
1.	General Idea – We want the user to be able to enter a few bits of information that would provide them activities to enrich their lives.

2.	Target audience – Users seeking new and unique hobbies they normally would not seek out.

3.	Problem being solved – This would provide more culture and enrich users lives to put them out of their comfort zone. They would be able to serach locally so that they would not enter a geographical area they may not want to be in.

4.	Primary goal of product – User goes to website and comes out with an idea for an activity.

5.	Identify and prioritize user stories A user story is something that can use problem solving into actionable items and make sure that you’re adding value instead of features. 

A. As a user, I want an activity so that I can get motivated to learn/do something new. 

B. As a developer, I want the user to be able to come back with an idea they may be able to use for themselves, a date, their family.
